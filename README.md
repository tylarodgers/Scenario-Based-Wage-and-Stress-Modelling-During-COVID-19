# COVID-19 Income & Well-being Analysis-Scenario Based Wage and Stress Modelling (Stata | First Class Econometrics Project)

📌 **Grade: First Class (University of East Anglia – ECO-5006A, 2024)**  
📁 **Tools:** Stata | Statistical Modelling | Scenario Simulation | Hypothesis Testing

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project uses real UK panel data to examine how the March 2020 COVID-19 lockdown affected individual labour income and mental health. It was completed as part of my Econometrics module at UEA and awarded a First Class mark.

The work applies regression-based modelling, interaction terms, prediction simulation, and model diagnostics — skills directly relevant to trading, optimisation, and data-driven decision-making roles.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Quantify change in **daily income** and **stress levels** before and after lockdown  
- Identify the role of factors such as **gender**, **education**, and **health** in shaping outcomes  
- Simulate predicted changes under hypothetical individual profiles  
- Use statistical diagnostics to assess and improve model reliability

---

## 📊 Key Techniques Used

- **OLS regression**  
- **Log transformation** (for scaling income)  
- **Interaction terms** (e.g., gender × education effects)  
- **Margins** and **marginsplot** for scenario prediction  
- **Robust standard errors** (model correction for heteroskedasticity)  
- **Breusch-Pagan test** (diagnostic)  
- **Linear Probability Model (LPM)** for binary outcomes  
- **Dummy variables** and **categorical encoding**  
- Data cleaning, feature generation, and panel comparison

---

## 📈 Highlights

- Built multiple regression models to estimate post-lockdown wage and stress effects  
- Predicted income and stress levels for individuals with different characteristics (e.g., high earners vs. low earners, qualified vs. unqualified, healthy vs. unwell)  
- Demonstrated how gender and job role interact to shape vulnerability during economic shocks  
- Re-estimated models using robust SEs to ensure coefficient reliability  
- Identified limitations in LPM predictions and compared model performance

## 🧰 Skills Demonstrated

- Statistical modelling & scenario analysis  
- Applied use of **Stata** for real-world data problems  
- Predictive modelling using interaction terms and margins  
- Model validation & correction (robust SEs, diagnostics)  
- Clear communication of quantitative findings in a structured report

## 💡 Why This Matters

This project shows how I apply statistical thinking and software tools to uncover insights from uncertainty. While developed in an academic setting, the same logic applies in:

- Trading and risk forecasting  
- Economic impact analysis  
- Pricing strategy under shocks  
- Labour market trend modelling
